#### Environment Settings
1. Python >= 3.9 is required
```bash
conda create -n football python=3.9.13
```
```bash
conda activate football
```
2. Install required packages
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pygame gymnasium
```
3. PyTorch >= 2.3 is required

___

#### Training

1. Train PPO with 12d observation space
```bash
python path/to/rf/train_ppo.py
```
- Training logs will be saved at `path/to/rf/ppo_football_logs/`, you can use tensorboard to do visualization.
```bash
tensorboard --logdir path/to/rf/ppo_football_logs/tensorboard
```

2. Train PPO with 8d observation space
```bash
python path/to/rf/train_ppo_8d.py
```
- Training logs will be saved at `path/to/rf/ppo_football_logs2/`, you can use tensorboard to do visualization.
```bash
tensorboard --logdir path/to/rf/ppo_football_logs2/tensorboard
```

___

#### Run the Game
> Please run ***Train ppo with 12d observation space*** in **Training** section before running game: `game_ppo.py` and `game_hybrid.py`! 

Take `game_ppo.py` as example:
```bash
python path/to/game/game_ppo.py
```
___

#### Test the Game
> Please run ***Train ppo with 12d observation space*** and ***Train ppo with 8d observation space*** in **Training** section before doing test!

Take `test_ruleBesed_ppo.py` as example:
> **DO NOT** close the game window during the test!
```bash
python path/to/test/test_ruleBesed_ppo.py
```
